        <h3>A brief aside</h3>
        <p>
            This article will be a bit different from all the others so far. While the others have mostly been
            high-level descriptions of how the X server works, together with interactive demos, today we're going
            in depth into one of the cool data structures of the X server.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the first Xplain article, I mentioned a data structure known as the "region", which is a list of
            rectangles. When I first built Xplain, I took the region code from
            <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/pixman">pixman</a> and compiled it with emscripten, simply because
            I didn't understand the algorithms. Frankly, I'm terrible at algorithms. I must have looked at tens of
            different explanations of sorting algorithms over the course of my career, and I still don't understand
            how they actually work.
        </p>

        <p>
            For my own fun, I recently decided to investigate the data structures and algorithms behind regions,
            and I finally understood it. What I found I'm going to share with you.
        </p>
        </section>

        <section id="what-are-regions">
        <h3>What are regions?</h3>
        <p>
            As mentioned previously, regions are lists of rectangles. You can also think of them as a 1-bit bitmap,
            where every pixel is either black or white. However, actually storing them as a 1-bit bitmap is expensive,
            so we use a different representation, which optimizes for common cases, and is more convenient and faster
            to operate on than large bitmaps.
        </p>
        <p>
            The X server uses regions all over the place when computing the amount of coverage each window has. So,
            given the desktop below:
        </p>

        <div class="demo-canvas" data-demo="region-desktop"></div>

        <p>
            Then the text editor window has as its "visible region" the following L shape.
        </p>

        <div class="demo-canvas" data-demo="region-desktop-L"></div>

        <p>
            The X server has to compute these regions efficiently whenever windows are created, destroyed or moved to
            figure out which window should be painted at which location, and which input should receive mouse events.
        </p>

        <p>
            The X server has four basic operations it can run on regions:
        </p>

        <div class="demo-canvas" data-demo="region-basic"></div>

        <ul>
            <li>
                When we add two regions together, we produce a <strong>union</strong> of them. It's as if you
                took two pieces of cardboard, laid them on top of each other, and then traced that as the
                resulting region. Perhaps surprisingly, the X server doesn't use this operation very often.
            </li>
            <li>
                The area that a window can paint to doesn't include its child windows, since the child windows
                paint there instead. So, when calculating a window's region, we first intersect with the parent,
                then <strong>subtract</strong> out the regions of any children the window has.
            </li>
            <li>
                Windows are clipped to their parents. When we want to calculate the region, in absolute
                space, that a window occupies, we <strong>intersect</strong> the window's region its parent's.
            </li>
            <li>
                When a window changes its shape, we need to paint two areas: space the window occupies that it
                didn't before, and space the window no longer occupies. Calculating the areas that are different
                between two regions is known as <strong>xor</strong>,
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or">after the bitwise operator</a>, which can
                be thought of as calculating which bits differ between two integers.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            To get that "L" shaped region of the text editor above, we take the two rectangles of the two windows,
            subtract the bottom one from the top one, and we have our "L".
        </p>

        <section id="the-guts">
        <h3>What is a region made of?</h3>
        <p>
            Before we fully go into these algorithms, let's first go over what a region is. I've previously mentioned
            it's a "list of rectangles", so let's start with that. For the example region below, there are of course
            many different lists of rectangles we could make that result in that image.
        </p>
        <div class="demo-canvas" data-demo="region-incorrect-regions"></div>
        <p>
            Are all of these regions? Do our algorithms have to handle all of these cases? It turns out that the answer
            is "no". A valid region is not just any list of rectangles, but an <em>ordered, minimal set of horizontal
            bands</em>. What does that mean? Let's work through it. First, let me show you the correct construction of
            our example region.
        </p>
        <div class="demo-canvas" data-demo="region-correct-regions"></div>
        <p>
            OK. The graphics programmers in the room are now smirking. I'll explain why later. But, let's start chewing
            apart our definition. First up, let's talk about "horizontal bands". A "band" in this case looks like this:
        </p>
        <div class="demo-canvas" data-demo="region-bands"></div>
        <p>
            A <strong>band</strong> is simply a list of rectangles that all start and end at the same Y position. We only
            have one other rule about the rectangles in a band: they must not touch or overlap. If two rectangles in a band
            touch or overlap, they can be coalesced into one rectangle. Using these rules, we can "formally" define a band
            as an "ordered, minimal set of rectangles with the same top and bottom".
        </p>
        <p>
            A region, it might follow, is simply a bunch of these bands stacked on top of each other. We also make the same
            rule here: it is not possible for bands to overlap or touch in their top and bottom positions. This can be
            unintuitive for the case of what look like visibly separate bands. You might imagine that the region below has
            two bands, but our "overlapping" rule means that it must have three.
        </p>
        <div class="demo-canvas" data-demo="region-misleading-region"></div>
        <p>
            Somewhat intuitively, these two rules mean that for one given "bitmap", there is actually only one way to
            construct it as a region.
        </p>
        </section>

        <section id="merging-bands">
        <h3>Merging bands</h3>
        <p>
            With these definition, let's start constructing our algorithm. First, let's start with the simpler case:
            two bands with the same tops and bottoms together. For our example, we'll start with union, but we can
            start generalizing it afterwards.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since all of the rectangles in a band have the same top and bottom, we only care about the starts and ends
            of these rectangles on the X axis. I'm going to call these two values "walls". Given that rectangles in
            our bands do not overlap or touch, it can be intuitive to see that we will always have an even number of
            these walls, and that the first wall "enters" the region, while the second wall "exits" the region. The
            third enters, the fourth exits &mdash; it's a toggle.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember that these two bands have the same tops and bottoms. I'm only putting them on two different Y axes
            in the demonstration below simply so that you can see them both at the same time, since they do overlap.
        </p>
        <div class="demo-canvas" data-demo="region-walls"></div>
        <p>
            Visually, it's very easy to see what the correct union for these two bands would be: 20 and 50. But
            algorithmically, it can be difficult to figure out what to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            For future reference, whenever you see a data structure construction like this, with a big focus on slicing
            up simple geometry into horizontal segements, it's a pretty big hint that we're going to perform a
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_line_algorithm">"sweep-line algorithm"</a>. These are also sometimes
            called "scanline" algorithms in the graphics and game development space, and they are so common there, that a lot
            of game developers I know of first start imagining ways to reduce problems to a scanline algorithm.
            That's why I said they'd be there, smirking in the background. They've known this trick for <em>decades</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            What we're going to do is walk over the walls of both bands at the same time, and then keep track of
            whether we're inside our outside of corresponding the band. When we transition from being outside both bands
            to being inside both bands, or vice versa, we output a wall.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="js">function unionBands(bandA, bandB) {
    // The resulting band from the union.
    var outWalls = [];

    // The index into the walls of both.
    var iA = 0, iB = 0;

    // Whether we're inside either band.
    var insideA = false, insideB = false;

    while (iA &lt; bandA.numWalls || iB &lt; bandB.numWalls) {
        var wallA = bandA.walls[iA];
        var wallB = bandB.walls[iB];

        // The next wall we want to process is the one on the left,
        // that is, the minimum of the two.
        var wall = Math.min(wallA, wallB);

        // Whether we're outside or inside the bands.
        var wasInside = (insideA || insideB);

        // Update our state for both bands, and advance to the next wall.
        if (wall == wallA) {
            iA++;
            insideA = !insideA;
        }
        if (wall == wallB) {
            iB++;
            insideB = !insideB;
        }

        // Are we now inside?
        var isInside = (insideA || insideB);

        // If we're transitioning from inside to outside or outside to
        // inside, then output a wall.
        if (isInside != wasInside)
            outWalls.push(wall);
    }

    return outWalls;
}</code></pre>
        <p><sub>
            Yes, I know this code is actually broken. In the case where we run out of one set of walls, then we'll
            retrieve <code>undefined</code> from the array, and <code>Math.min</code> will return <code>NaN</code>.
            This is a complexity that I'm choosing not to deal with in the pseudo-code above.
        </sub></p>

        <p>
            Let's run through this, visually, in our heads.
        </p>
        <div class="demo-canvas" data-demo="region-walls-walkthrough">
            <ol>
                <li> Pick the leftmost wall we haven't encountered. That's the wall on the left, 20. Now we're inside band A.
                Since we weren't inside either band beforehand, we output a new wall, 20. </li>
                <li> Pick the next wall. That's 30. We're now inside B, but since we were inside A before, we don't emit a wall. </li>
                <li> The next wall is 40. We exit A. Since we're still inside B, we don't emit a wall. </li>
                <li> The next wall is 50. We finally exit B. Since we're no longer inside either band, we emit a wall, at 50. </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p>
            So it does work!
        </p>
        </section>

        <section id="other-operations">
        <h3>Implementing other operations</h3>
        <p>
            Now we've implemented the basic "union bands" algorithm. What about intersection, subtraction, and xor? Let's
            look at intersection first. The core of the algorithm is <em>when we output a wall</em>. For union, we output
            a wall when we transition from not being inside either band to being inside either band, or vice versa. For
            intersection, we should do it when we change from not being inside <em>both</em> bands to being inside
            both bands, and vice versa. So the only code that changes are the values of <code>wasInside</code> and
            <code>isInside</code>, which become <code>insideA &amp;&amp; insideB</code>. In fact, for all four operations,
            there's a boolean test for every one.
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Union</dt> <dd><code>insideA || insideB</code></dd>
            <dt>Intersection</dt> <dd><code>insideA &amp;&amp; insideB</code></dd>
            <dt>Subtraction</dt> <dd><code>insideA &amp;&amp; !insideB</code></dd>
            <dt>XOR</dt> <dd><code>insideA != insideB</code></dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
            In my actual implementation, not being content with ugly closures and, you know, <em>actual code</em>, I
            implemented each operation as a <a href="https://github.com/magcius/xplain/blob/gh-pages/src/region.js#L87-L118">bitwise trick</a>.
            But it doesn't have to be that way &mdash; all I'm doing is implementing the above four operations a bit
            more concisely.

        <section id="full-regions">
        <h3>Putting it back together</h3>
        <p>
            Now we know how to merge bands together. How can we use this to our advantage to merge regions? While
            you might just start iterating over the bands of each region, and merging them together blindly, we have
            to be a tad more careful than that. Let's look at a fairly sophisticated case.
        </p>
        <div class="demo-canvas" data-demo="region-fork"></div>
        <p>
            This region looks a bit like a fork. We have a left part, which is one band with one rectangle. Then we
            have the part on the right, which has three separate bands. How many bands do we have when we union it
            together?
        </p>
        <div class="demo-canvas" data-demo="region-fork-decomposed"></div>
        <p>
            ... five. Hm, so, somehow, one and three make five.
