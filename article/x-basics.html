        // Hi there! Since you're looking at this, I'm sure you'd like to know a
        // bit more about the demos in this article.
        //
        // For starters, as I mention at the end of the article, the code that
        // powers all the demos in this article is at GitHub:
        //
        // https://github.com/magcius/xplain
        //
        // Most of the code that I've written is in the X server itself,
        // which can be found at src/server/server.js
        //
        // The extensive "Inspector" can be found in src/inspector/inspector.js
        //
        // The rest of the demos are clients that connect to that server, and
        // they can be found in src/article-demos/.
        //
        // The main demo "runner" framework is at src/article-demos/demos.js,
        // and the code for all the demos in the article are littered around
        // in that directory.
        //
        // I've tried to document it quite well, but if you have any more questions
        // about the code, about anything in this article, or just want to flame
        // me about Wayland or Mir, feel free to contact me through email.

        <section id="lets-go">
        <h3>Let's go</h3>
        <div class="demo-server demo-inspectable" data-demo="calculatorCSD"></div>
        <p>
            Here's our example app. Excuse the programmer graphics, I'm simply just trying to represent
            <a href="http://xawm.sourceforge.net/">the state of the art of the time</a>. It's a simple reverse polish
            notiation calculator. For those of you not old enough to remember them, try pressing
            <span class="calculator-button">7</span>, <span class="calculator-button">ENT</span>,
            <span class="calculator-button">6</span>, then press <span class="calculator-button">*</span>.
            It's not built very well, and you can probably break it fairly easily by making it display
            <span class="calculator-result">NaN</span> by playing around with it.
        </p>
        <p>
            But that's OK, because a stable calculator app isn't really the point here. While not a very complex, it's
            good enough that it allows us to start understanding the basics of the X Window System.
        </p>
        <p>
            You might notice that <span class="inspector-icon">i</span> button in the top right of the demo above.
            Click on it, and the inspector will pop open. On the left side is the window tree, and on the right side
            are the properties and attributes for the selected window.
        </p>
        <p>
            <q>Wait a minute... window <em>tree</em>?</q>
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes. While you might imagine that the calculator above looks like it's only one window to us, the users,
            it's actually built of 15 distinct windows. In the X Window System, as you can possibly imagine, a
            <span class="definition">window</span> is the basic building block of the system. At a very basic level,
            windows are simply rectangles that can receive input events like keyboard and mouse events, and display
            pixels in their area.
        </p>
        <p>
            Windows always have a parent. Windows live in the coordinate space of their parent, and the bounds of
            <a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/xproto/x11protocol.html#glossary:Inferiors" class="definition">inferior windows</a>,
            or child windows, are clipped to their parent. By default, every window is parented to
            the <span class="definition">root window</span>, a special window owned and created by the X server.
        </p>
        <p>
            If this sounds familiar to you, you might realize that this sounds an awful lot like the DOM tree
            in HTML. A recursive data structure where every node can take input and draw to the screen... and
            I don't blame you. However, windows in the X Window System and HTML-style DOM nodes have a lot of
            subtle differences that make the X Window System's abstractions a bit less useful for building
            widgets on. And that's what we're gonna be exploring next.

        <section id="expose-model">
        <h3>Exposing historical baggage</h3>
        <p>
            In the late 80s, when the X Window System was designed, RAM was costly, and was a scarce resource.
            If we stored window contents in system memory, if you want to have a maximzed window, that would be,
            well, 1 byte * (800 * 600 pixels) =
            <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=1%20byte%20*%20800%20*%20600%20=">almost half a megabyte!</a>
            The user can't open more than 10 maximized windows before exhausting the 5MB in his workstation, and
            with 16-bit True Color around the corner, we can't fit more than 5! No, no, this can't possibly scale.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, if we can't store window pixels in system memory, where can we store them? They have to exist
            somewhere, <em>right</em>?
        </p>
        <p>
            Nope. The trick the X Window System authors realized is that the pixels for a window don't have to exist
            at all. We only have one giant buffer of pixels for the entire screen, the
            <span class="definition">front buffer</span>, and windows borrow pixels to draw to.
        </p>
        <div class="demo-server demo-inspectable" data-demo="expose"></div>
        <p>
            The demo above shows two windows, with one window obscuring the other. The window underneath moves from
            side to side, and you can see that when it moves, the window blanks out for a moment before redrawing
            itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            The window on top, marked as <span class="code-literal">kitten1.jpg</span> in the inspector, owns
            a rectangle in the center of the screen. The window below, <span class="code-literal">kitten2.jpg</span>,
            owns a "L" shape slightly above and to the left.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the X server needs pixels from a window, it tells the window to redraw the area it's missing
            pixels for using an
            <a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/xproto/x11protocol.html#events:Expose" class="code-literal">
            Expose</a> event. The window then responds by submitting drawing commands back to the X server.
            The X server then processes all these drawing commands, touching pixels on the front buffer where the
            window is.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also drag <span class="code-literal">kitten1.jpg</span> around. Try it, and see if you can figure
            out how this behaves.
            <a href="http://www.mrdoob.com/lab/javascript/effects/ie6/">Does it seem familiar?</a> The authors of
            Windows 95 chose the same design when they wrote their display server, however they called their equivalent
            to the Expose event
            <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd145213%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" class="code-literal">WM_PAINT</a>
            instead.

        <h3>Windows of all shapes and sizes</h3>
        <div class="demo-server demo-inspectable" data-demo="shape"></div>
        <p>
            I said above that windows are rectangles. Strictly speaking, that's not quite true. Above is a window
            that has a circle shape. Dragging it around might slow your system down to a crawl, though. Internally, the
            X server keeps a 1-bit bitmap (think white/black pixel mask) for every window, containing the part of the
            overall rectangle that is currently showing on the screen. This data structure is called the
            <span class="definition">clip list</span> in Xorg. It's not actually a 1-bit bitmap, though, it's actually
            a data structure known as a <span class="definition">region</span>. You might recognize this if you've
            ever used the <a href="http://cairographics.org">cairo graphics library</a>, as it has an implementation
            of it in
            <a href="http://cairographics.org/manual/cairo-Regions.html" class="code-literal">cairo_region_t</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            A region is an alternate representation for a 1-bit bitmap: a list of rectangles. In almost of the cases
            that the X server will use a region, this representation is both more computationally-efficient and
            memory-efficient than a 1-bit bitmap. A simple exception is a checkerboard pattern (like the stipple background on the server above!), since there will be a lot of small, 1-pixel rectangles.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're an old Linux user, you might remember old versions of the
            <a href="http://enlightenment.org/">Enlightenment</a> desktop environemnt having a strange way to do
            transparency by masking windows with a similar checkerboard pattern. If you turned this effect on all
            your windows, your system would start to chug a little, since the checkerboard pattern is very stressful
            on the region data structure and X server implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ahem, sorry. Enough reminiscing. Anyway, the story goes that when people working on the X server source
            code were doing anything with windows, they had code that looked like this:
        </p>
        <div class="code-block">void do_something_with_window(Window window)
{
    Region region = new Region();
    region.add_rectangle(window.bounding_rectangle);

    region.intersect_rectangle(other_window.whatever);
    display.draw_some_nonsense(region);
}</div>
        <p>
            That is, the code was almost always taking the window's bounding rectangle, and then converting it into a
            region to use elsewhere. So, they said to themselves, <q class="historical-quote">Hey, why don't we let the
            user set any arbitrary region that will be used instead of the bounding region?</q> And thus, the
            <a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/xextproto/shape.html">X SHAPE Extension</a> was born.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is how we get a circular window, as above: we construct a region of a circle, and then set
            the window's bounding region to be that circle. This is how the classic
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeyes">xeyes</a> and oclock get their shapes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The inspector will show the bounding shape region of a window in yellow.
        </p>
        <p>
            There's two more notes I want to make here. Although this might seem like it would allow for some windows
            to be transparent by poking holes in them, it's an all-or-nothing proposition. That is, if you point to
            any pixel in the server, I can tell you the window that will paint to that pixel. The X SHAPE Extension
            doesn't change this, it just makes the logic for figuring out which window "owns" a specific pixel more
            complicated. In order to allow truly transparent windows, we'll have to somehow figure out to blend between
            what windows draw.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, setting a bounding region larger than the window's width/height can't actually make the
            window own pixels that it wouldn't own otherwise. The bounding region only allows a window to carve
            away from where it would normally paint and give that space to the windows underneath.
