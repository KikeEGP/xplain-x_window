        <h3>Last time...</h3>
        <p>
            Last time, we talked about some basic principles of 2D graphics and how one might implement
            a basic 2D graphics rasterizer. Today, we'll take a step back and look a bit more carefully
            about what we did. Along the way, we'll develop a more generalized and abstract model for
            2D graphics and rasterization, and from that new understanding, start building the standard
            toolbox of techniques that is commonly seen in vector graphics: affine transformations,
            filled polygons, Bezier curves. Finally, we'll contrast this with contemporary 3D graphics
            and GPUs, and see if we can find some commonality between our approaches.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's worth pointing out that while we do have a "standard toolbox" consisting of strokes, fills,
            line caps, mitered joints and Bezier curves that's seen consistently from HTML5's &lt;canvas&gt;
            to Microsoft's GDI, it wasn't always this way. Though we rarely hear of it today, a little language
            known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript">PostScript</a> remains quite possibly
            the largest influence for programmers and artists that interact with 2D vector graphics. Since it's
            important (and fun!) to learn, let's take a trip back in time. Back before CRTs and pixels. Back,
            all the way, to the 1960s.
        </p>

        <section id="history">
        <h3>The rise of PostScript</h3>
        <p>
            The early days of computer graphics were dominated by "plotter printers" which operated on a
            pen-down, pen-up kind of fashion, usually driven by some form of basic ASCII command language.
            HP, manufacturer of some of the earliest plotter printers, used a variant of BASIC called "AGL"
            which sent commands in a proprietary language, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-GL">HP-GL</a>,
            to the printer. During the 1970s, we saw the rise of affordable graphics terminals, starting with
            the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tektronix_4010">Tektronix 4010</a>. It has a CRT for its
            display, but don't be fooled: it's <em>not</em> a pixel display. Tektronix came from the analog
            oscilloscope industry, and these machines work by driving the electron beam dynamically, not in a
            grid-like order. As such, the Tektronix 4010 didn't have pixel output. Instead, you sent commands to it with
            <a href="http://vt100.net/docs/vt3xx-gp/chapter13.html#S13.14">a simple graphing mode</a> that drew lines
            but, again, in a pen-up pen-down fashion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like a lot of other inventions, this all changed at Xerox PARC. Researchers there were starting to develop
            a new kind of printer, one that was more computationally expressive than what was seen in plotters.
            This new printer was based on a small, stack-based Turing-complete language called Forth, and they named it...
            the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpress">Interpress</a>! PARC was, obviously, unable to sell it,
            so the inventors jumped ship and founded a small, scrappy startup named "Adobe". They took Interpress with them
            and tweaked it until was no longer recognizable. The result: PostScript. Besides the cute, turing-complete
            stack-language language it comes with to calculate its shapes, the original
            <a href="http://wwwimages.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/postscript/pdfs/PLRM.pdf">PostScript Language Reference</a>
            marks up an Imaging Model in Chapter 4, near-identical to the APIs we widely see today. Example 4.1
            of the manual has a code example which can be translated to HTML5 &lt;canvas&gt; nearly line-by-line:
        </p>
<pre style="display: inline-block; width: 380px; margin-left: 20px;"><code style="margin-top: 0;">/box {
    newpath
    0 0 moveto
    0 1 lineto
    1 1 lineto
    1 0 lineto
    closepath
} def

gsave
72 72 scale
box fill
2 2 translate
box fill
grestore
</code></pre>
<pre style="display: inline-block; width: 380px;"><code style="margin-top: 0;" class="javascript">function box() {
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.moveTo(0, 0);
    ctx.lineTo(0, 1);
    ctx.lineTo(1, 1);
    ctx.lineTo(1, 0);
    ctx.closePath();
}

ctx.save();
ctx.scale(72, 72);
box(); ctx.fill();
ctx.translate(2, 2);
box(); ctx.fill();
ctx.restore();
</code></pre>
        <div class="demo-canvas" data-demo="rast2-postscript-canvas"></div>
        <p>
            This is not a coincidence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apple's Steve Jobs had met the Interpress engineers on his visit to PARC. Jobs thought that the printing business
            would be lucrative, and tried to simply buy Adobe outright. Instead, Adobe countered and instead sold a five-year
            license for PostScript to Apple. At the same time, Jobs and Apple were funding a small startup, Aldus, which was
            making a WSYWIG app to create PostScript documents, "PageMaker". In early 1985, Apple released the first
            PostScript-compliant printer, the Apple LaserWriter. The combination of the point-and-click Macintosh,
            PageMaker, and the LaserWriter singlehandedly turned the printing industry on its head, giving way to
            "desktop publishing" and solidifying PostScript its place in history. The main competition, Hewlett-Packward, would
            eventually license PostScript for its competing LaserJet series of printers in 1991, after consumer pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
            PostScript slowly moved from being a printer control language to a file format in and of itself.
            People eventually wanted to make files of PostScript art and graphics, so the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulated_PostScript">Encapsulated PostScript</a> format was quickly
            hacked together by Adobe. It used specially marked PostScript comments to give metadata about the size of the image,
            its preferred orientation, and so on, and restricted the use of commands to render new pages. Adobe's Illustrator
            was designed to export to Encapsulated PostScript files, for designing and embedding graphics in word processors,
            which then created... PostScript documents to send to PostScript printers. The whole world was PostScript.
            Microsoft, while working on Windows 95, wanted to create its own graphics API for developers, and a primary
            goal was making it PostScript-compatible so the graphics could be sent to a printer as easily as a screen.
            This API was eventually released as
            <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd145203(v=vs.85).aspx">GDI</a>. Underneath the hood,
            a graphics engine known as "GRE" PostScript
            When people decided they did not like the idea of a Turing-complete interpreter for document display for
            performance reasons, Adobe developed and released the
            <a href="http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf">PDF specification</a>
            aping the same graphics model.
            By the time the W3C started to standardize on a 2D graphics markup language, Adobe championed the XML-based
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-PGML-19980410">PGML</a>, which had the PostScript graphics model
            front and center. I quote: <q>PGML should encompass the PDF/PostScript imaging model to guarantee a 2D scalable
            graphics capability that satisfies the needs of both both casual users and graphics professionals.</q>
            Microsoft's competing format,
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-VML">VML</a>, was based on GDI, which was based on PostScript. Both
            standards were eventually combined to make SVG.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though it's old, let's not pretend that the innovations PostScript brought to the world are anything
            less than a technological marvel. Apple's PostScript printer, the LaserWriter, had a CPU twice as powerful as the
            Macintosh that was controlling it, just to interpret the PostScript and rasterize the vector paths to points on
            paper. If you were already buying a fancy printer with a <em>laser</em> in it, the expensive CPU on the side
            doesn't seem so expensive in comparison. In its first incarnation, PostScript invented a fairly sophisticated
            imaging model, with all the features that we take for granted today. But the most powerful, wowing feature?
            Fonts. Fonts were, at the time, drawn by hand with rule and protractor, and cast onto film, to be
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phototypesetting">printed photochemically</a>. Knuth's METAFONT and TeX
            systems started the digital typesetting revolution, but it didn't catch on to replace existing optical printers,
            since the geometrically-described fonts became blurry and unreadable at small sizes. Adobe's PostScript proposed
            a novel solution to this: an algorithm to "snap" paths to the finer grid of the small point sizes. This is known
            as "grid-fitting". To prevent the geometry from getting too distorted, they allowed fonts to specify "hints"
            about what parts of the geometry should be preserved.
        </p>
        <p>
            Adobe's original business model was to sell this font technology to people that make printers, and sell special
            recreations of fonts, with added hints, to publishers, which is why Adobe, to this day, sells their versions of
            <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/times/">Times</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/futura/">Futura</a>.
            Adobe can do this, by the way, because fonts, or, more formally, "typefaces", are one of
            <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?node=se37.1.202_11">five things explicitly excluded by US
            Copyright Law</a>, since they were originally designated as "too plain or utilitarian to be creative works".
            What <em>is</em> sold and copyrighted instead is the <em>digital program</em> that reproduces the font on the
            screen. So, to prevent people from copying Adobe's fonts and adding their own, the
            <a href="https://www-cdf.fnal.gov/offline/PostScript/T1_SPEC.PDF">Type 1 Font</a> format was originally
            proprietary to Adobe and contained "font encryption" code. Only Adobe's PostScript could interpret a Type 1 Font,
            and only Adobe's Type 1 Fonts had the custom hinting technology allowing them to be visible at small sizes. Once
            Adobe got into the prosumer software market instead, they later standardized and released the specifications to
            Type 1 Fonts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Font hinting, by the way, was so universally popular that when Microsoft and Apple were tired of paying
            licensing fees to Adobe, they invented an alternate method for their font file competitor,
            <a href="https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TrueType-Reference-Manual/">TrueType</a>.
            Instead of specifying declarative "hints", TrueType gives the font author a
            <a href="https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TrueType-Reference-Manual/RM03/Chap3.html">complete turing-complete stack</a>
            so that the author can control every part of grid-fitting (and conveniently avoiding Adobe's patents on hinting).
            For years, the wars between the Adobe-backed Type 1 and the TrueType raged on, with font foundries being
            stuck in the middle, having to provide both formats to their users. Eventually, the industry reached a compromise:
            <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Typography/OpenTypeSpecification.aspx">OpenType</a>.
            But rather than actually decide a winner, they simply plopped both specifications into one file format: Adobe took Type 1
            fonts, removed the encryption bits, gave them a small amount of spit polish, and released
            <a href="http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/font/pdfs/5176.CFF.pdf">CFF</a>/
            <a href="http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/font/pdfs/5177.Type2.pdf">Type 2</a> fonts</a>,
            which were plopped into OpenType as the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/cff.htm">cff table</a>.
            TrueType, on the other hand, got plopped in as
            <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/otff.htm#ttTables">glyf</a> and other tables.
            OpenType, while ugly, seemed to get the job done for users, mostly by war of endurance: just require that all
            software supports both kinds of fonts, because that's what OpenType mandates.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, we're forced to ask: if PostScript didn't become popular, what might have happened instead?
            It's worth looking at some other alternatives. The previously mentioned METAFONT didn't use filled paths.
            Instead, Knuth, in typical sense, rigourously defines in his paper
            <a href="http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~millerpd/docs/501_Winter13/Knuth79.pdf">Mathematical Typography</a>
            the concept of a curve that is "most pleasing". You specify a number of points, and algorithm finds the
            one correct path through these. You can stack these paths on top of each other: define such a path as a "pen",
            and then "drag the pen" through some other path. Knuth introduced componentization and recursion to path definition.
            Knuth's thesis student, John Hobby, designed and implemented algorithms for calculating
            <a href="http://i.stanford.edu/pub/cstr/reports/cs/tr/85/1047/CS-TR-85-1047.pdf">the "most pleasing curve"</a>,
            <a href="http://ect.bell-labs.com/who/hobby/thesis.pdf">"flattening" the nested recursion of paths</a>,
            <em>and</em> <a href="http://ect.bell-labs.com/who/hobby/87_2-04.pdf">rasterizing such curves</a>.
            For more on METAFONT, curves, and fonts in general, I <em>highly</em> recommend the somewhat dated, but
            amazingly detailed reference of <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596102425.do">Fonts &amp; Encodings</a>,
            and the papers of <a href="http://ect.bell-labs.com/who/hobby/Publications.shtml">John D. Hobby</a>.

        <p>
            ... Apologies if that was too long. I hope that was as fascinating to you as it is to me. Let's get
            back to graphics.
        </p>
        </section>

        <section id="coverage">
        <h3>Establishing Coverage</h3>
        <p>
            In the first article, we established the idea of "coverage", and the process of "rasterization", which
            takes our ideal shape and lossily maps it onto the pixel grid. So, for now, let's continue our understanding
            of shapes and coverage by <em>tossing the color out the window</em>. The fancy fill styles, the colors,
            the gradients, they weren't really that important: they were sort of the final shiny effect after we
            rasterized our shape. But for now, let's make bigger shapes. Better shapes. Polygons and polylines and fancy
            splines under the influence of affine transformations. Where we're going, we don't need color, we need coverage.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a refresher, let's give you some basic coverage. Basic, geometric, <em>functional</em> methods of coverage.
            You give me a function that tells me whether it's inside or outside the shape, I plot it on the grid. You ready?
        </p>

        <div class="demo-slot" data-demo="rast2-coverage-editor-1"></div>

        <p>
            You'll be seeing this sort of code editor show up across this article. Try to both read and understand the
            reference code. To help you out, you can modify and play with it! Don't be afraid, it won't freeze your
            browser, even if you stick in a <code>while(true) ;</code> in there. You can also resize the final output
            canvas to make it taller if you want more room to play.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, just so you're aware, graphics code <em>tends</em> to have short and sweet variable names. "x" and "y"
            should hopefully be pretty obvious, but conventions like "dx", "cx", "sy" are a bit less obvious. In my code,
            "dx" means "distance x" or "delta x" and means a difference between two X coordinates. The "c" in "cx" tends
            to stand for "center", and the "s" in "sy" tends to stand for "shape", as in, the shape's coordinates.
            "w" is width, "h" is height, "hw" is "half-width". You'll also see "x2" which tends to mean "the right side
            of a rectangle", aka "x+w". The more you play with it, the more you start to recognize and be able to read
            graphics code. I tell you now because when you go look it up, you'll see this sort of stuff everywhere, and
            it's a really good habit to figure out how to read this more... terse sort of graphics lingo. Everyone has
            their own style, and I certainly am not the best or cleanest programmer, but it matches the level of terseness
            you'll see among the industry. It can be challenging, but if I can figure it out, so you can you. I promise.
        </p>
        </section>

        <section id="boolean">
        <h3>Combining Shapes</h3>
        <p>
            Now that you're familiar with the basics, let's start off with a puzzle. Let's say we wanted to build a
            long, "capsule" type shape. It has caps for circles at the ends, connected with a giant rectangle in the middle.
            Using the tools we have right now, can we <em>combine</em> them to make this new shape?
        </p>

        <div class="demo-slot" data-demo="rast2-coverage-editor-2"></div>

        <p>
            We can, of course, combine shapes by using <em>boolean operators</em>. In the above example, we're
            considered inside the capsule as long as we're inside <em>any</em> of the shapes: the two circles
            or the connecting rectangle. This technique goes back to the earliest days of computer graphics, but
            <a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/publications/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf">modern</a>
            <a href="http://iquilezles.org/www/articles/distfunctions/distfunctions.htm">variations</a> on the
            technique have brought it back from the realm of the forgotten.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, we can also use all the boolean operators available to us, in the same way we calculated
            our bands in <a href="regions.html">Regional Geometry</a>, to union, intersect, subtract, and xor shapes.
            What kinds of shapes can you come up with?
        </p>
        </section>

        <section id="transforms">
        <h3>Squash and Stretch</h3>
        <p>
            We've mostly played with circles and rectangles, and it's easy to see why: they're extremely basic and
            simple primitives. But sometimes we want things that move with weight, things that have elasticity,
            things that morph and rotate and skew. It's
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_basic_principles_of_animation">important for animation</a>,
            after all. We can easily adjust our coordinates of a rectangle to make it wider than tall, but it's a
            bit unclear about how to do that with a circle. And what about other transformations besides simple
            scaling, like skewing or rotating? It's unrealistic to modify all of our primitives to support this.
            How can we easily, <em>generically implement transformations?</em>
        </p>

        <div class="demo-canvas" data-demo="rast2-transforms-1"></div>

        <p>
            It becomes easy by changing our perspective. Instead of changing our shapes, we change how we sample it.
            To make an ellipse that's twice as long, we put our samples closer together along the X axis. You can also
            think of this as "shrinking" our pixel grid. When we unshrink the pixel grid back to normal again, we find
            an elongated circle.
        </p>

        <div class="demo-canvas" data-demo="rast2-transforms-2"></div>

        <p>
            We can actually implement a lot of different kinds of transformations this way. By morphing our grid in
            weird ways, we can implement something along the lines of Photoshop filters to our shape. This functionality
            isn't something usually provided in typical 2D graphics libraries. There, they restrict our ability to squash
            and stretch to something a bit simpler to render, called a "linear transformation".
        </p>
        <p>
            A <span class="definition">linear transformation</span> is one that only adds the inputs together, without
            using anything like sines or divisions. Any linear equation can be normalized to take the form <code>x' = 1*x + 3*y</code>,
            where we line up the variables in order and put the multiplicative terms. As a notational convenience,
            we can drop the "template" part of the expression and just jot down the coefficients, in a sort of box shape.
            The resulting box is known as a <span class="definition">matrix</span>. Matrices have lots of uses in math
            and computer science and graphics but it's easy to forget that it means the same as the above set of
            linear expressions. You might have seen these matrices before. If you're having trouble with matrices, try
            converting them to expression form &mdash; I often find the expression form is easier to read and understand.
