            This article relies a lot of interactive demos that use JavaScript. I understand you're
            disabling JavaScript because you've been burned by heavy scripts and tracking on other sites,
            but the article really doesn't work without the ability to play with it.
            I write every line of code in these demos from scratch, minus the snippet of Google Analytics
            that lets me know when people read these so I can join in the conversation. Feel free to block
            Google Analytics.

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            The goal of Explanations is to try to allow people to play with fun parts of computers. Graphics,
            compression, audio. The tagline is my biggest inspiration: "Play, don't show", riffing off the
            typical "Show, don't tell" rule of writers and authors everywhere. Why bother giving a diagram when
            I give you an inspector and let you poke at things yourself!
        </p>
        <p>
            It takes me a long time to write an Explanation, so these might not come out as quick as you like,
            but I do plan on writing these as long as I'm able to. I also don't claim to be the world's expert
            on most everything I'm writing about. I might be wrong! Please let me know by
            <a href="mailto:jstpierre@mecheye.net">email</a> or through
            <a href="https://github.com/magcius/xplain/issues/new">a GitHub issue</a>.

            Previously, this series was known as "Xplain" and was more focused on the X11 window system and
            protocol, but I've been slowly moving towards anything that interests me, since I really like the
            format and style I've developed. The code for every single one of these demos is available in theme
            <a href="https://github.com/magcius/xplain">GitHub repo</a>, and I do try to comment heavily and
            try to give more depth. Play with the code! Use it for one of your own projects! It's all MIT/X11
            licensed. I also appreciate questions and feedback.

            The source code to this article and all demos is freely available under the MIT/X11 license on
            <a href="http://github.com/magcius/xplain">GitHub</a> for inspection.

        <p>
            Some of the more tricky code in there has been ported from the
            <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver">Xorg X server</a> itself along with its helper library,
            <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/pixman/">pixman</a>.

            Some of the images in this article have been adapted from other images on the web. The two kitten images
            in the Expose event demo were adapted from photos taken by
            <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/titrans/">quatre mains</a> and
            <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fazen/">fazen</a>, shared under a
            <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC-BY-2.0</a> license. Thanks to
            <a href="http://placekitten.com/attribution.html">[placekitten]</a> for finding these images for me.
        </p>
        <p>
            The cursors and icons used in the demos have been adapted GNOME's default theme,
            <a href="https://git.gnome.org/browse/adwaita-icon-theme/">Adwaita</a>.
            Some of the icons in the inspector have been adapted from the
            <a href="https://github.com/gnome-design-team/gnome-icons/tree/master/art-libre-symbolic">GNOME Art
            Libre Symbolic Icon Theme</a>, shared under the LGPL and CC-BY-SA-3.0. All rights reserved.

            <a href="http://fishsoup.net/">Owen Taylor</a> for digging into the source code, protocols, mailing lists
            and other archives to help me figure out some of the more odd and hairier X11 semantics when I was working
            on this. Sorry for driving you guys crazy with this project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks to my friends and colleagues who have sent me feedback on work-in-progress articles,
            and to anybody who has sent me a pull request. You guys rock.
