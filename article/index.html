		<h3 id="introduction">Introduction <a href="#introduction">&para;</a></h3>
		<p>
			Last year, I wrote <a href="http://blog.mecheye.net/2012/06/the-linux-graphics-stack/">
			an article</a> describing the free and open-source graphics
			stack, explaining all of the interconnected pieces: X11, graphics drivers,
			DRM, and DRI, and their roles in getting pixels placed on the screen. In
			the year since, I've answered a lot of really good questions from the
			community which made me think and learn and grow, and I've also started
			helping out on a port of GNOME to Wayland.
		</p>
		<p>
			Compared to some of my coworkers, I'm relatively new to the Linux development
			scene, with only five or so years of experience. I've also arrived late,
			way after we've added lots of hacks to keep the X Window System fresh,
			like RENDER and COMPOSITE.
		</p>
		<p>
			The X Window System has clearly outgrown its original purpose with clever hacks,
			but that doesn't mean it's unworkable. After all, Microsoft Windows made all the
			same design decisions in their display server technology back when they were
			developing Windows 95, and they've either adapted or reinvented most of the same
			clever hacks to modernize their operating system. As anybody who reads
			<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/">Raymond Chen's excellent blog</a>
			knows, Microsoft takes backwards compatibility extremely seriously, so they cannot
			introduce any changes that would break existing applications.
		</p>
		<p>
			My purpose here isn't to prove a point about how new display server technologies
			like Wayland and Mir are future (even though I personally believe they are).
			Think of this article as a history lesson, starting back at the X Window System
			in the 80s, and accelerating all the way to modern day versions of the X Window
			System, with a modern composited window manager. For comparison purposes, I'll
			also end with a modern display server, modelled after Wayland, to show how we
			can unravel all of the incremental improvements we've done over the years to
			build something fresh and exciting.

		<h3 id="self-test">But before we begin... <a href="#self-test">&para;</a></h3>
		<p>
			Since this article contains a lot of interactive demos relying on fairly modern
			browser technology, let's make sure that everything is OK before continuing. I've
			been testing this on modern versions of Firefox Nightly and Chrome Canary.
		</p>
		<div class="demo-server test"></div>
		<p>
			If you can see the stipple pattern above, that means that your browser is modern
			enough to see the interactive demos.
		</p>
		<p>
			You might have noticed that when you ran your mouse over the stipple, your cursor
			changed. That's because this isn't just any old stipple image, that stipple is
			actually the background of a full X server session running in your browser using
			HTML5 canvas. All of the interactive demos will use this.
		</p>
		<p>
			The source code to this article and the framework I've is freely available under
			the MIT/X11 license at <a href="http://github.com/magcius/xserver.js">my GitHub</a>
			for inspection. Some of the more tricky code in there has been ported from the
			<a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver">Xorg server</a> itself, and
			the code doing region calculations has been compiled from the
			<a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/pixman/">pixman</a> graphics library.

		<h3 id="basic-architecture">Basic Architecture <a href="#basic-architecture">&para;</a></h3>
		<p>
			Although it may sound a bit stilted, notice how I keep saying "the X Window System"
			instead of the more traditional shorthands "X", "X11", or "Xorg"? I want to be very
			careful to separate the ideas and design of the system from its component parts.
		</p>
		<p>
			The X Window System is a networked display system. A server component, the
			<strong>X server</strong>, is responsible for coordinating between all of the clients
			connected, and for taking input from the mouse and keyboard, and for pushing pixels
			on the output. The most popular X server implementation is the <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver">Xorg X server</a>, developed by the X.Org Foundation. There are other X
			server implementations, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xsun">Xsun</a>,
			and this <a href="http://microxwin.com/">extremely scary X server</a> implemented
			as a Linux kernel module!
		</p>
		<p>
			X servers and X clients all talk a standardized network protocol to each other,
			known as <a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/xproto/x11protocol.html">X11</a>.
			These network protocols are implemented by libraries like
			<a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/libX11/specs/libX11/libX11.html">Xlib</a>
			and <a href="http://xcb.freedesktop.org/">xcb</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			I need to be extremely careful during this article.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I talk about a feature	or design decision in the overall system, I will say "X Window System".
		</p>
		<p>
			When I talk about features or details of the network protocol, I will say "X11 protocol".
		</p>
		<p>
			When I talk about the behavior of a client or a server, I'll say "X client" or "X server".
		</p>
		<p>
			When I talk about an implementation detail in the Xorg X server, I'll say "Xorg X server".
		</p>
		<p>
			If I ever say "such-and-such is a feature of X", it's a bug.
