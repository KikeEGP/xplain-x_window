        // Hi there! Since you're looking at this, I'm sure you'd like to know a
        // bit more about the demos in this article.
        //
        // For starters, as I mention at the end of the article, the code that
        // powers all the demos in this article is at GitHub:
        //
        // https://github.com/magcius/xplain
        //
        // Most of the code that I've written is in the X server itself,
        // which can be found at src/server/server.js
        //
        // The extensive "Inspector" can be found in src/inspector/inspector.js
        //
        // The rest of the demos are clients that connect to that server, and
        // they can be found in src/article-demos/.
        //
        // The main demo "runner" framework is at src/article-demos/demos.js,
        // and the code for all the demos in the article are littered around
        // in that directory.
        //
        // I've tried to document it quite well, but if you have any more questions
        // about the code, about anything in this article, or just want to flame
        // me about Wayland or Mir, feel free to contact me through email.

        // systems so people could comment on this article in one place,

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Last year, I wrote <a href="http://blog.mecheye.net/2012/06/the-linux-graphics-stack/"> an article</a>
            describing the free and open-source graphics stack, explaining all of the interconnected pieces: X11,
            graphics drivers, DRM, and DRI, and their roles in getting pixels placed on the screen. In the year since,
            I've answered a lot of really good questions from the Linux community about my post, and I've started
            getting more involved in Wayland development as part of our goal to <a
            href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/Wayland">port GNOME to Wayland</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Compared to some of my colleagues, I'm relatively new to the Linux development scene, with only five or so
            years of experience. I've also arrived late, way after we've added lots of hacks to keep the X Window
            System fresh.
        </p>
        <p>
            My purpose here isn't to discredit the X Window System entirely as a series of bad decisions one after
            another, and praise Wayland as the holy grail of desktop development. I do believe that the future of
            display server technology is with a design like Wayland as opposed to something more antiquated X11.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead, Think of this article as a history lesson, starting way back at the X Window System in the 80s,and slowly tacking on everything we've introduced into Linux Graphics to keep it fresh, like
            <a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/renderproto/renderproto.txt">RENDER</a>,
            <a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/compositeproto/compositeproto.txt">COMPOSITE</a>, and
            <a href="http://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/">DRI</a>. I'm here to lay out the facts, give some historical
            records, and hopefully teach you a few things about how X works internally if you've ever had trouble
            understanding it.

        <section id="self-test">
        <h3>But before we begin...</h3>
        <p>
            Since this article contains a lot of interactive demos relying on fairly modern browser technology, let's
            make sure that everything is OK before continuing. I've been testing this on modern versions of Firefox
            Nightly and Chrome Canary.
        </p>
        <div class="demo-server" data-demo="test"></div>
        <p>
            If you can see the stipple pattern above, that means that your browser is modern enough to see the
            interactive demos.
        </p>
        <p>
            You might have noticed that when you ran your mouse over the stipple, your cursor changed. That's because
            this isn't just any old stipple image, that stipple is actually the background of a full X server session
            running in your browser using HTML5 canvas. All of the interactive demos will use this framework to explain
            what's going on under the hood.
        </p>

        <section id="basic-architecture">
        <h3>Basic Architecture</h3>
        <p>
            Although it may sound a bit stilted, notice how I keep saying "the X Window System" instead of the more
            traditional shorthands "X", "X11", or "Xorg"? I want to be very careful to separate the ideas and design of
            the system from its component parts.
        </p>
        <p>
            The X Window System is a networked display system. A server component, the
            <span class="definition">X server</span>, is responsible for coordinating between all of the clients
            connected, taking input from the mouse and keyboard, and pushing pixels on the output. The most popular X
            server implementation is the <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver">Xorg X server</a>,
            developed by the X.Org Foundation and community. There are other X server implementations: you might
            remember that Xorg was forked from <a href="http://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86</a> a decade ago, that Sun
            Microsystems has had several X server implementations, in both
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xsun">Xsun</a> and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xnews_%28X11_server%29">XNeWS</a>. Today, Xorg is the dominant
            X server implementation, getting most of the development. But back in the day, multiple competing implementations existed.
        </p>
        <p>
            X servers and X clients all talk a standardized network protocol to each other, known as
            <a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/xproto/x11protocol.html">X11</a>. This protocol is
            well-specified, from the wire format to the semantics of every request. The protocol documentation linked
            above is invaluable documentation for any hacker who wants to learn more about this stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
            Applications and toolkits don't write the wire format onto the socket directly, however. They often use
            client libraries that implement the protocols, like the traditional
            <a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/libX11/specs/libX11/libX11.html">Xlib</a> library, or the
            somewhat newer <a href="http://xcb.freedesktop.org/">xcb</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm going to try and be precise in my nomenclature in this article.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I talk about features or design decisions of the overall system, I will try to call it
            <span class="definition">the X Window System</span>, even if it sounds a bit verbose. e.g.
            <q><span class="definition">The X Window System</span> provides us Pixmaps, which are images in the server's memory.</q>
        </p>
        <p>
            When I talk about features or details of the network protocol, I will talk about
            <span class="definition">the X11 protocol</span>. e.g. <q><span class="definition">The X11 protocol</span>
            provides for a generic extension mechanism, which allows for a forward-compatible way to implement new
            features without having to redesign older parts of X11</q>.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I talk about the behavior of a client or a server, I'll say <span class="definition">X client</span>
            or <span class="definition">X server</span> e.g. <q>Using the MIT-SHM extension, <span class="definition">X
            clients</span> can pass memory buffers to the <span class="definition">X server</span> using POSIX shared
            memory, which prevents networking and large copies</q>.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I talk about features or the architecture in the Xorg X server implementation, I'll mention it
            explicitly as <span class="definition">Xorg</span> or <span class="definition">the Xorg X server</span>,
            e.g. <q>In order to make drawing calls accelerated, <span class="definition">Xorg</span> video drivers can
            provide hardware-accelerated versions of certain drawing primitives through EXA.</q>
        </p>
        <p>
            If I ever say "such-and-such is a feature of X", it's a bug.

            Some of the more tricky code in there has been ported from the

            The cursors used in the demos are from the cursors used by GNOME's default theme,
