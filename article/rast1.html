        <h3>Widening the horizon</h3>
        <p>
            While this article series is named "Xplain", and while I try to focus on concepts related to the
            X11 window system and its architecture, I often want to write about other topics, ones that are
            related, but maybe a bit more general than just X11-specific. The Regions article was an example
            of that. Today, I'm going to talk about basic software rasterization of 2D graphics. While not
            an X11-specific concept, I feel it will be interesting to the same audience, and I'll include it
            in the Xplain series. Going forward, Xplain will probably not be just about X11.
        </p>

        <p>
            Something I have been interested in for quite some time, and something I feel is not very
            widely understood, are the basics of 2D graphics and 2D graphics rasterization. I often see
            comments like "oh, if only SVG was implemented with WebGL, then it would be fast", and realize
            that people do not quite understand the challenges and complications of 2D graphics rendering.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, we will be exploring 2D graphics by writing a software rasterizer of our own. All of the
            code was written for this article, and is open source on the GitHub repo. I've tried to comment
            it well as a source to learn from. I encourage you to study it.

        <h3>The Pixel Grid</h3>
        <p>
            The X11 articles take place in a hand-written X11 server. Regional Geometry took place, well,
            in the land of geometry. Today's article takes place...
        </p> 

        <div class="demo-canvas" data-demo="rast1-grid-demo"></div>

        <p>
            ... on the pixel grid. By the end of this article series, hopefully you will be able
            to, if not write something of this complexity, at least understand what is going on and how
            it works.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've magnified each pixel so it is easier to see. Specifically, each "demo pixel" here
            is 8 "real pixels" wide, and the same tall. The grid itself is composed of 128 of these
            "demo pixels" horizontally, and 64 of them vertically.
        </p>
        <p>
            It might hurt your head to think about "demo pixels" and "real pixels". Graphics programming
            often takes place in lots of different "spaces" like this. After quite a long time of doing it,
            I still get confused; it's just part of the job description. If you are having trouble, what
            helps me is to just turn off the monitor, grab a pen and paper, or a whiteboard, and just draw
            the different things out.
        </p>
        <p>
            When your head hurts for far too long and you start getting confused, you will just start
            peppering <code>x*8</code> and <code>(y+15)/8</code> into your code in a vain attempt to just
            get everything to match up correctly. You will start fiddling with your plus and minus signs,
            wildly reversing your translations and rotations at random in a desperate attempt to get
            things to just line up, dammit. It is not a good place to be.

        <h3>Coordinates</h3>
        <p>
            While I'm sure everyone here doesn't need a refresher, let's over some notation and basic math
            for how to address pixels in this grid. We often treat pixel buffers as large arrays in memory,
            and we usually leave them one-dimensional, and do the math ourselves to find a specific index
            for a given position.
        </p>
        <p>
            Buffer layouts in the real world have a lot of subtleties &mdash; whether that's stride alignment,
            endianness issues or pixel formats. If you don't know what any of those things are, don't worry,
            I'll talk about them later. In this article series, we'll be using the convention established by
            HTML5's <a class="code-literal" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ImageData">ImageData</a>
            API. We see this pixel grid as a giant, one-dimensional array of bytes, with each pixel taking four
            bytes: red, green, blue, alpha, in that order.
        </p>

        <div class="demo-canvas" data-demo="rast1-imagedata-pixel-format"></div>

        <p>
            We can find the index of the first byte of a pixel, and vice versa, with some very simple math:
        </p>

<pre><code class="javascript">var BYTES_PER_PIXEL = 4;

function indexForPixelLocation(imageData, x, y) {
    return (y * imageData.width + x) * BYTES_PER_PIXEL;   
}

function pixelLocationForIndex(imageData, idx) {
    var pixelIdx = Math.floor(idx / BYTES_PER_PIXEL);
    var y = Math.floor(pixelIdx / imageData.width);
    var x = pixelIdx % imageData.width;
    return { x: x, y: y };
}
</pre></code>

        <p>
            Familiarize yourselves with what these functions do &mdash; they convert from the x and y
            coordinates of pixels on the grid to their index into the array of pixels.
        </p>

        <section id="draw-rectangle">
        <h3>Let's Draw a Rectangle</h3>
        <p>
            Now that we've established ourselves with the format of the pixel grid, let's try drawing
            a rectangle. For simplicity's sake, let's just fill it with black for now.
        </p>

<pre><code class="javascript">function fillPixel(imageData, x, y) {
    var idx = indexForPixelLocation(imageData, x, y);
    imageData.data[idx + 0] = 0; // Red
    imageData.data[idx + 1] = 0; // Green
    imageData.data[idx + 2] = 0; // Blue
    imageData.data[idx + 3] = 255; // Alpha
}

function fillRectangle(imageData, x1, y1, width, height) {
    for (var y = y1; y < y1 + height; y++)
        for (var x = x1; x < x1 + width; x++)
            fillPixel(imageData, x, y);
}
</pre></code>

        <p>
            And let's set it in motion!
        </p>

        <div class="demo-canvas" data-demo="rast1-fillrect-basic"></div>

        <p>
            This should be pretty straightforward, but there are a few pecularities I do want to go over.
            First, it might strike some of you as add to iterate over the "y" first. It does not make any
            difference in this case, but graphics programmers often thing about things in vertical rows.
            This is a holdover from early computer graphics, and it's for performance reasons &mdash;
            if you think about the memory layout of our pixel grid, you'll notice that iterating over the
            indexes in order. While RAM does stand for "random access memory", CPUs cheat and have things
            called "caches". Just know that it is cheaper to write to indexes in order than it is to jump
            around at random.
        </p>
        <p>
            While it does not matter too much in our example, you should be aware that iterating over the
            rows of a pixel grid first is common convention. This will become more apparent when we start
            going over more complex topics.
        </p>
        <p>
            It should also hopefully be pretty clear how to replace this "black" with another color, so I
            won't bother explaining that. I will, however, up the ante. Let's try filling this rectangle
            with some gradients.
        </p>
        </section>

        <section id="gradients">
        <h3>Styling our Rectangle</h3>
        <p></p>
        <div class="demo-canvas" data-demo="rast1-gradients"></div>

        <p>
            A gradient allows us to fill a shape with more than one color, by blending a bunch of different
            colors together. The simplest gradient is the Radial gradient, which makes a "ball" of colors.
            A simple radial gradient has four properties: a center position from where the ball will expand
            from, the color at that center position, a radius which tells us where the ball stops, and the
            color at that radius.  
        </p>
        <p>
            For each pixel in our rectangle, we can compute its distance to the center point, and that tells
            us how much of each color to use.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our updated code here looks like:
        </p>

<pre><code class="javascript">function newRGB(r, g, b) {
    return { r: r, g: g, b: b };
}

// Mix colors "color1" and "color2" together at time value "t",
// where 0 is "color1" and 1 is "color2".
function mixRGB(color1, color2, t) {
    var newR = (color1.r * (1.0 - t)) + (color2.r * t);
    var newG = (color1.g * (1.0 - t)) + (color2.g * t);
    var newB = (color1.b * (1.0 - t)) + (color2.b * t);
    return newRGB(newR, newG, newB);
}

function newRadialGradient(centerX, centerY, radius, centerRGB, edgeRGB) {
    return function(x, y) {
        // Calculate distance from the center point.
        var distX = x - centerX, distY = y - centerY;
        var distance = Math.sqrt(distX*distX + distY*distY);

        // If we're outside the circle, then just return the color at the edge.
        // This is a choice -- we could instead choose to repeat or ping-pong
        // between the colors.
        if (distance >= radius)
            return edgeRGB;

        // Translate the [0, radius] ranged value to a [0, 1] ranged value
        // so we can mix the colors.
        var t = distance / radius;
        return mixRGB(centerRGB, edgeRGB, t);
    };
}

// The same code as above, but slightly adapted to handle fill styles
// and custom colors.

function fillPixel(imageData, x, y, rgb) {
    var idx = indexForPixelLocation(imageData, x, y);
    imageData.data[idx + 0] = rgb.r;
    imageData.data[idx + 1] = rgb.g;
    imageData.data[idx + 2] = rgb.b;
    imageData.data[idx + 3] = 255; // Alpha
}

function fillRectangle(imageData, fillStyle, x1, y1, width, height) {
    for (var y = y1; y < y1 + height; y++) {
        for (var x = x1; x < x1 + width; x++) {
            var rgb = fillStyle(x, y);
            fillPixel(imageData, x, y, rgb);
        }
    }
}
