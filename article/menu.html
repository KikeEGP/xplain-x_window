        <h3>Tunnel vision</h3>
        <p>
            Writing this series is difficult. I often grapple with trying to come up with compelling demos,
            an understandable, linear story to tell, with understandable writing. I want to show people the
            power of how the X11 protocol works in practice. And a lot of the time, I struggle to come up
            with an topic I can make interesting in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the last little while, I've wanted to build up to an article on window managers, and so I
            write a bunch of accurate JavaScript which implements a window manager, and I write xclock
            and xlogo and a panel for people to play around with. I talk about the ICCCM, and window
            reparenting, and grab semantics, but, well, it just never comes out good. It becomes a bunch
            of tedious minutae more than an interesting premise.
        </p>
        <p>
            And so I switched gears, and talked about the region data structure, for instance. And I was
            able to write that in a day or two. I want to write more, but it's easy to get discouraged
            when I have a topic but can't find a way to make it feel good.
        </p>
        <p>
            I focused too heavily on "window managers", struggling to fit the pieces, that I forgot about
            my goal for this series. I want to teach people about the different pieces of the X11 protocol,
            why they exist, and how we've been able to build real-world applications with the sometimes
            fairly unintitive primitives it provides.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today's article is not about window managers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, we're going to learn about why building a seemingly simple widget, the humble dropdown
            menu, is a lot harder than first appearances might lead you to believe. Together, we'll
            learn a lot about grabs in the X11 input model, about why subwindows aren't at all useful,
            and maybe, just maybe, learn a bit about Wayland as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sounds like fun? I hope so.

            Here. I've placed a tiny image viewer widget in front of you. It's like the kitten windows
            from the first set of articles, but it now has a few extra features &mdash; it allows you to
            resize it with a grip at the bottom right, and it allows you to drag with the grip in the top
            left, It also has a drop-down menu directly to the right of the move grip.
