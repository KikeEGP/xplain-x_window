            Writing this series is fairly difficult. Not just with cool demos and code, that's actually
            the easy bit. Picking my topics requires care, and to be quite honest, I've mostly covered
            a lot of the stuff that can be written about, standalone, without a corresponding history
            lesson and footnotes by the dozens.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some stories aren't linear; sometimes an architecture meshes together so well that all of
            the pieces are required to understand it all, and that makes it difficult to explain any
            one piece. Sometimes we decide that the future hasn't worked out the way we envisioned it,
            and so what was initially a beautiful design starts crumbling down over time because our
            core design assumptions just aren't true.
        </p>  
        <p>
            For the last little while, I've wanted to build up to an article on window managers, and so I
            write a bunch of accurate JavaScript which implements a window manager, and I write xclock
            and xlogo and a panel for people to play around with. I talk about the ICCCM, and window
            reparenting, and grab semantics, but, well, it just never comes out good. It becomes a bunch
            of tedious minutae, because, honestly, it just kind of is.
        </p>
        <p>
            And so I switched gears, and talked about the region data structure, for instance. And I was
            able to write that in a day or two. I want to write more, but it's easy to get discouraged
            when I have a topic but can't find a way to make it feel good.
        </p>
        <p>
            I focused too heavily on "window managers", struggling to fit the pieces, that I forgot about
            my goal for this series; why I want to write this. I want to teach people about the hard problems
            that exist when building any sort of complex windowing system, about the obscure pitfalls we've
            encountered, the clever solutions we've designed together, and how we've been able to modernize
            a protocol that has truly, not withstood the test of time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today's article is not about window managers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, we're going to learn about building a dropdown menu. In X11. If that doesn't sound hard
            to you, please, read on. Together, we'll learn a lot about grabs in the X11 input model, about
            the one fatal flaw in the X11 subwindow model, and maybe, just maybe, learn a bit about Wayland
            as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sounds like fun? I sure hope so.

        <h3>The humble dropdown menu</h3>

        <div class="demo-server" data-demo="example-kitten"></div>
        <p>
            Here. I've placed a tiny image viewer app in front of you. It's like the kitten windows
            from the first set of articles, but it now has a dropdown menu. I've also launched a window
            manager so you can drag it around, and resize it using the borders. It even reacts pretty
            gracefully to resizing.
        </p>
        <p>
            At first thought, a dropdown menu doesn't seem too difficult, does it? Just have a little
            widget that that draws itself, and then when clicked, opens up a menu. In
            <a href="http://magcius.github.io/xplain/article/window-tree.html">Advanced Window Techniques</a>,
            I even described that the window system is equipped with this idea of subwindows. We can
            simply make our dropdown menu a subwindow. Simple, right? Let's try it out.
        </p>
        <div class="demo-server" data-demo="subwindow"></div>
        <p>
            Oops. Unfortunately for us, subwindows are <em>clipped</em> to their parents, so we can't
            simply use that when the window is too small. Unfortunately, the X11 protocol doesn't have
            a way of creating a subwindow like this that isn't clipped. Our workaround for this is to
            use a <em>separate toplevel window</em>. We also have to make sure that this new toplevel
            is positioned in the right spot.
        </p>
        <div class="demo-server" data-demo="dumb-toplevel-attempt"></div>
        <p>
            Hm. It seems the <em>window manager</em> is putting a frame on our menu. While nifty, it's
            not quite the effect we wanted. To determine how to work around it, we first have to learn
            how a window manager knows how to put frames around our windows.

        <h3>The window manager</h3>
        <p>
            As I've mentioned in the past, X11 has a concept of "mechanism, not policy". For anything
            that seems like it's a user interface problem, or the domain of the desktop environment, X11
            doesn't like to make assumptions or enforce a certain way of doing things. It leaves this
            up to a special client known as a "window manager". We've talked about such a manager client
            before when we talked about <a href="composite.html">the COMPOSITE extension</a>, which could
            draw windows with transparency in the middle.
        </p>
        <p>
            The window manager has a large range of responsibilities to client applications. Most
            obviously, it serves as a graphical user interface allowing for moving around, resizing,
            and restacking windows on the desktop. Less obviously, it manages a lot of pecularities
            of modern window managers, like constraints to prevent windows from being resized too
            small or too big, or accidentally being pushed under your taskbar or resting on a monitor
            that has now been unplugged. And, although we won't get into the details in this article,
            it serves as an API of sorts for other applications on the system that might want to
            interact with the desktop.
        </p>
        <p>
            This API, along with the general protocol that window managers are supposed to follow is
            described in the
            <a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/xorg-docs/icccm/icccm.html">Inter-Client Commmunications Conventions Manual</a>,
            which goes over this sort of client-to-window-manager communication in extreme detail.
            We won't be going over too much of the ICCCM today &mdash; it's a large, complex topic
            with its own detailed and rich history. Today, we'll simply be going over the basics of
            how a simple, non-ICCCM-compliant window manager works.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a quick refresher, if you want to know when someone presses a button or clicks a key,
            you can use
            <a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/libX11/libX11/libX11.html#XSelectInput" class="code-literal">XSelectInput</a>
            to "select" for these kinds of events on your window. These applications aren't simply
            limited to input events, however. If you want to know when a window is mapped, you can
            select for the <a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/xproto/x11protocol.html#events:MapNotify" class="code-literal">MapNotify</a>
            event. In fact, you don't even have to own the window in question &mdash; you can listen to
            events on "someone else's" window just fine.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the X11 developers added hooks so people could write window managers, they did so in
            the form of a special event type you could select with <span class="code-literal">XSelectInput</span>.
            Namely, they added a way of getting a notification when someone tries to create a new subwindow.
            They called it <span class="code-literal">SubstructureNotify</span>. Whenever anyone tries to map
            a new toplevel window, a <span class="code-literal">MapNotify</span> event will be sent to anybody
            who has <span class="code-literal">SubstructureNotify</span> selected. A variety of these events
            are sent out whenever someone tries to map, unmap, resize, or reparent windows, allowing interested
            clients to monitor and perhaps even override behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given this primitive, I imagine it seems relatively straightforward to write a simple window
            manager. When getting a <span class="code-literal">MapNotify</span> for a new window, create
            a frame window, reparent the window into the frame. If you want to make a tiling window manager,
            for instance, start moving all the frames around.
        </p>
        <p>
            As one extra convenience, instead of simply being "notified" that new windows have showed up
            or a window tried to move itself, you can in fact stop such behavior entirely. If you select
            for the <span class="code-literal">SubstructureRedirect</span> event mask instead, you won't
            get just <span class="code-literal">MapNotify</span> events, you'll get
            <a href="http://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/xproto/x11protocol.html#events:MapRequest" class="code-literal">MapRequest</a>
            events. Now, whenever a new window tries to map itself, the X server stops, says "whoa, hold
            on a minute", and <em>redirects</em> the request over to you, and you can decide the fate of
            the window. You can decide whether to map it, or leave it invisible forever. The power is in
            your hands.
        </p>
        <p>
            The X11 developers did leave one tiny bit of wiggle room, though. They thought that perhaps
            there might perchance be a case where the application <em>does</em> know better, and left an
            escape hatch, in the form of an attribute called "override-redirect". If a window sets this,
            it will <em>override</em> the <span class="code-literal">Substructure<em>Redirect</em></span>
            behavior, and not allow the window manager to intercept its events.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, while that does mean that your window is free-spirited and independent from the shackles
            of a window manager, it also means you don't get any of its help, either. You don't get a
            frame where the user can move or resize your window. The window manager won't even restack
            you when users click on other windows. Those fancy APIs I talked about earlier? If window
            managers don't know about your window, because you nicely asked X11 not to tell the window
            manager about it, then you don't get to use them. The ICCCM dictates that the window manager
            shouldn't respond to any window it doesn't know about.
        </p>
        <p>
            But for a window like a dropdown that 1. should always be on top anyway, 2. shouldn't be able
            to be moved or resized anyway, 3. doesn't need any of those fancy APIs, the override-redirect
            attribute is exactly what we want. So let's go ahead and set it.
        </p>
        <p>
            And, as a quick aside, if you are ever unfortunate enough to run into an X11 window manager
            developer, like me, we'll tell you that they know about your tricks anyway. While we don't
            get the <span class="code-literal">MapRedirect</span>, we'll certainly get the <span class="code-literal">MapNotify</span>
            event. In fact, since we're often writing a compositing manager that has to composite
            <em>all of the windows</em>, we have plenty of code to detect override-redirect windows. We
            have to be very careful with such "OR windows", since the rulebook says we really aren't supposed
            to know about them. We make sure never to restack them, never ever to move or resize them,
            and god forbid try putting a frame around them.
        </p>
        <p>
            *ahem* sorry about that. Let's go ahead and set override-redirect on our dropdown menu, shall we?
